Ulmo's Adventure
================

A fork of Sam Eldred's http://code.google.com/p/rpg-world/

What's New
----------
* (10/06/2013) Forked from svn into git
* (10/06/2013) Use a Wii-mote to control Ulmo

Now optimised for the Raspberry Pi!
-----------------------------------
Help Ulmo evade enemies, collect coins and find his way to the end of an 
amazing (but short) adventure. Use cursor keys to move, space to do stuff,
X to toggle sound and ESC to quit.

16-bit style graphics, a top-down perspective and tile-based maps - a retro
style RPG much like the old SNES classics. Also features some pseudo-3D 
elements, eg. the ability to move underneath bridges, etc.

Graphics were created in Gimp, sounds in CFXR. The game itself is 
implemented in Python/Pygame and the map editor is in Java SWT.
